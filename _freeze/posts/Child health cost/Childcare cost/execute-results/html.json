the utilization of tidymodels framework for the optimization of an xgboost model through [early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping#:~:text=In%20machine%20learning%2C%20early%20stopping,training%20data%20with%20each%20iteration.), employing the current week’s #TidyTuesday [dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-05-09) on childcare expenses in the United States.\n\n## Exploratory data analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r

When dealing with large datasets with many variables, some of which are strongly correlated, I frequently use xgboost as a modeling algorithm due to its effectiveness.\n\nBefore we proceed with the modeling, it’s beneficial to conduct some exploratory data analysis. Specifically, we’re interested in understanding how the **mcsa** (the median weekly cost for school-aged children in childcare centers) has evolved over time.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers\nchildcare_costs |>\n  ggplot(aes(study_year, mcsa, group = study_year, fill = study_year)) +\n  geom_violin(alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Blues\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Childcare-cost_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet us visualize how are childcare costs related to `mhi_2018` (median household income) and `flfpr_20to64` (labor force participation for women).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchildcare_costs |>\n  ggplot(aes(mhi_2018, mcsa, color = flfpr_20to64)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_x_log10() +\nscale_color_distiller(palette = \"Spectral\")+ theme_minimal() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Childcare-cost_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn counties with lower income levels, the cost of childcare is observed to be relatively stable, while in counties with higher income levels, an escalation in childcare costs is noted. Furthermore, a higher prevalence of women participating in the workforce is seen in high-income counties.\n\nLet's check the racial composition of these counties.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchildcare_costs |>\n  select(mcsa, starts_with(\"one_race\"), mhi_2018) |>\n  select(-one_race) |>\n  pivot_longer(starts_with(\"one_race\")) |>\n  ggplot(aes(value, mcsa, color = mhi_2018)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(name), scales = \"free_x\") +\n  scale_color_distiller(palette = \"Spectral\")+ theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"% of population\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Childcare-cost_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn counties with a higher Black population (one_race_b), it is observed that both household income and childcare costs are lower. Conversely, in counties with a higher White population (one_race_w), both household income and childcare costs are seen to be higher. A trend appears to exist in counties with a higher Asian population (one_race_a), where an increase in the Asian population is associated with higher childcare costs. It is important to note that these relationships are not causal, but rather, they are indicative of the intricate interplay between race, socioeconomic class, and geographical location in the U.S.\n\n## Building a model\n\nThe initiation of our modeling process involves the establishment of our “data budget.” In this instance, the prediction target is mcsa (the costs associated with school-age children in childcare centers), necessitating the removal of other childcare cost measures related to babies, toddlers, and family-based childcare, among others. The FIPS codes, which explicitly encode location, are also to be removed, shifting the focus to county characteristics such as household income and the number of households with children. Given the substantial size of this dataset, it is [suggested](https://www.tmwr.org/resampling.html#validation) that a single validation set be utilized.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\nset.seed(111)\nchildcare_split <- childcare_costs |>\n  select(-matches(\"^mc_|^mfc\")) |>\n  select(-county_fips_code) |>\n  na.omit() |>\n  initial_split(strata = mcsa)\n\nchildcare_train <- training(childcare_split)\nchildcare_test <- testing(childcare_split)\n\nset.seed(222)\nchildcare_set <- validation_split(childcare_train)\nchildcare_set\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# Validation Set Split (0.75/0.25)  \n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  splits               id        \n  <list>               <chr>     \n1 <split [13269/4424]> validation\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGiven that all predictors are already in numeric form, there is no requirement for any special feature engineering; a formula such as mcsa \\~ … can be utilized. However, there is a need to establish a tunable xgboost model specification with [early stopping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/regularization-by-early-stopping/). The number of trees will be maintained as a constant (and not excessively high), the stop_iter (the early stopping parameter) will be set to tune(), and a few other parameters will be tuned. It should be noted that a validation set needs to be established (which in this case is a proportion of the training set) to be reserved for determining when to stop.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nxgb_spec <-\n  boost_tree(\n    trees = 500,\n    min_n = tune(),\n    mtry = tune(),\n    stop_iter = tune(),\n    learn_rate = 0.01\n  ) |>\n  set_engine(\"xgboost\", validation = 0.2) |>\n  set_mode(\"regression\")\n\nxgb_wf <- workflow(mcsa ~ ., xgb_spec)\nxgb_wf\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n══ Workflow ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nPreprocessor: Formula\nModel: boost_tree()\n\n── Preprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nmcsa ~ .\n\n── Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBoosted Tree Model Specification (regression)\n\nMain Arguments:\n  mtry = tune()\n  trees = 500\n  min_n = tune()\n  learn_rate = 0.01\n  stop_iter = tune()\n\nEngine-Specific Arguments:\n  validation = 0.2\n\nComputational engine: xgboost \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe model is prepared for deployment.
